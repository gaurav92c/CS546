    <h1>About Gaurav Singh Chauhan</h1>

    <main>

            <h2>General Information</h2>
            <p>I am a graduate student at <strong>Stevens Institute of Technology</strong>
                pursuing <em>Master of Science in Computer Science</em>. 
                I am from Mumbai, India. Back in India, I completed BE in Information Technology from
                Mumbai University with first class. In my engineering, I studied Databases,
                Data Structures and Algorithms and learned languages like Java, C# and SQL and implemented
                these technologies in a project I developed called Virtual Test Application.</p>
                <p>Then I got the opportunity to work for <strong>Vistex Aisa-Pacific Pvt. Ltd.</strong>
                as a <em>Software Developer</em>.
                Here I worked on a totally new technology for me, SAP. 
                I used ABAP and SQL for development and maintenance of application. 
                Also on a daily basis, I had to communicate to Consultants of Vistex clients to understand their 
                requirements/issues, discuss it with my team and implement/resolve it. </p>
