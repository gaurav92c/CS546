        <h1>My Doppelganger</h1>

        <main>
            <p>I boarded a flight traveling from Mumbai to Hyderbad. Other passengers were still settling down and I was 
                sitting on the emergency exit seats. I was really bored and listening to music.
                And this random guy comes and sits next to me. After a while one of the air hostess comes to
                explains the emergency exit instructions to us and the first thing she says 
                "Are you guys twins?". We both look at each other and start wondering
                how do we look so smiliar? This is how I met my doppelganger.</p>
